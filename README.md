# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Rafael. Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ˜Ž

**About me**..

ðŸ”­ I have completed the ISDI Coders Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, which provided me with a solid foundation in modern web technologies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m now focusing on enhancing my skills in advanced JavaScript frameworks like React and NextJS to provide totally functional and scallable solutions.

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and going for refreshing bike rides in the afternoon.
